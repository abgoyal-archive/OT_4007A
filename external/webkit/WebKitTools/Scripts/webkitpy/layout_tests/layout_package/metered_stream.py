"""
Package that implements a stream wrapper that has 'meters' as well as
regular output. A 'meter' is a single line of text that can be erased
and rewritten repeatedly, without producing multiple lines of output. It
can be used to produce effects like progress bars.

    meters.

    It can be used like a stream, but calling update() will print
    the string followed by only a carriage return (instead of a carriage
    return and a line feed). This can be used to implement progress bars and
    other sorts of meters. Note that anything written by update() will be
    erased by a subsequent update(), write(), or flush()."""
