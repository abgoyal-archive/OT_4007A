 /**
 *
 * \brief C API for Unicode Security and Spoofing Detection.
 *
 * These functions are intended to check strings, typically
 * identifiers of some type, such as URLs, for the presence of
 * characters that are likely to be visually confusing - 
 * for cases where the displayed form of an identifier may
 * not be what it appears to be.
 *
 * Unicode Technical Report #36, http://unicode.org/reports/tr36, and
 * Unicode Technical Standard #39, http://unicode.org/reports/tr39
 * "Unicode security considerations", give more background on 
 * security an spoofing issues with Unicode identifiers.
 * The tests and checks provided by this module implement the recommendations
 * from these Unicode documents.
 *
 * The tests available on identifiers fall into two general categories:
 *   -#  Single identifier tests.  Check whether an identifier is
 *       potentially confusable with any other string, or is suspicious
 *       for other reasons.
 *   -#  Two identifier tests.  Check whether two specific identifiers are confusable.
 *       This does not consider whether either of strings is potentially
 *       confusable with any string other than the exact one specified.
 *
 * The steps to perform confusability testing are
 *   -#  Open a USpoofChecker.
 *   -#  Configure the USPoofChecker for the desired set of tests.  The tests that will
 *       be performed are specified by a set of USpoofChecks flags.
 *   -#  Perform the checks using the pre-configured USpoofChecker.  The results indicate
 *       which (if any) of the selected tests have identified possible problems with the identifier.
 *       Results are reported as a set of USpoofChecks flags;  this mirrors the form in which
 *       the set of tests to perform was originally specified to the USpoofChecker.
 *
 * A USpoofChecker may be used repeatedly to perform checks on any number of identifiers.
 *
 * Thread Safety: The test functions for checking a single identifier, or for testing 
 * whether two identifiers are possible confusable, are thread safe.  
 * They may called concurrently, from multiple threads, using the same USpoofChecker instance.
 *
 * More generally, the standard ICU thread safety rules apply:  functions that take a
 * const USpoofChecker parameter are thread safe.  Those that take a non-const 
 * USpoofChecier are not thread safe.
 *
 *
 * Descriptions of the available checks.
 *
 * When testing whether pairs of identifiers are confusable, with the uspoof_areConfusable()
 * family of functions, the relevant tests are
 *
 *   -# USPOOF_SINGLE_SCRIPT_CONFUSABLE:  All of the characters from the two identifiers are
 *      from a single script, and the two identifiers are visually confusable.
 *   -# USPOOF_MIXED_SCRIPT_CONFUSABLE:  At least one of the identifiers contains characters
 *      from more than one script, and the two identifiers are visually confusable.
 *   -# USPOOF_WHOLE_SCRIPT_CONFUSABLE: Each of the two identifiers is of a single script, but
 *      the two identifiers are from different scripts, and they are visually confusable.
 *
 * The safest approach is to enable all three of these checks as a group.
 *
 * USPOOF_ANY_CASE is a modifier for the above tests.  If the identifiers being checked can
 * be of mixed case and are used in a case-sensitive manner, this option should be specified.
 *
 * If the identifiers being checked are used in a case-insensitive manner, and if they are
 * displayed to users in lower-case form only, the USPOOF_ANY_CASE option should not be
 * specified.  Confusabality issues involving upper case letters will not be reported.
 *
 * When performing tests on a single identifier, with the uspoof_check() family of functions,
 * the relevant tests are:
 *
 *    -# USPOOF_MIXED_SCRIPT_CONFUSABLE: the identifier contains characters from multiple
 *       scripts, and there exists an identifier of a single script that is visually confusable.
 *    -# USPOOF_WHOLE_SCRIPT_CONFUSABLE: the identifier consists of characters from a single
 *       script, and there exists a visually confusable identifier.
 *       The visually confusable identifier also consists of characters from a single script.
 *       but not the same script as the identifier being checked.
 *    -# USPOOF_ANY_CASE: modifies the mixed script and whole script confusables tests.  If
 *       specified, the checks will confusable characters of any case.  If this flag is not
 *       set, the test is performed assuming case folded identifiers.
 *    -# USPOOF_SINGLE_SCRIPT: check that the identifier contains only characters from a
 *       single script.  (Characters from the 'common' and 'inherited' scripts are ignored.)
 *       This is not a test for confusable identifiers
 *    -# USPOOF_INVISIBLE: check an identifier for the presence of invisible characters,
 *       such as zero-width spaces, or character sequences that are
 *       likely not to display, such as multiple occurrences of the same
 *       non-spacing mark.  This check does not test the input string as a whole
 *       for conformance to any particular syntax for identifiers.
 *    -# USPOOF_CHAR_LIMIT: check that an identifier contains only characters from a specified set
 *       of acceptable characters.  See uspoof_setAllowedChars() and
 *       uspoof_setAllowedLocales().
 *
 *  Note on Scripts:
 *     Characters from the Unicode Scripts "Common" and "Inherited" are ignored when considering
 *     the script of an identifier. Common characters include digits and symbols that
 *     are normally used with text from more than one script.
 *
 *  Identifier Skeletons:  A skeleton is a transformation of an identifier, such that
 *  all identifiers that are confusable with each other have the same skeleton.
 *  Using skeletons, it is possible to build a dictionary data structure for
 *  a set of identifiers, and then quickly test whether a new identifier is
 *  confusable with an identifier already in the set.  The uspoof_getSkeleton()
 *  family of functions will produce the skeleton from an identifier.
 *
 *  Note that skeletons are not guaranteed to be stable between versions 
 *  of Unicode or ICU, so an applications should not rely on creating a permanent,
 *  or difficult to update, database of skeletons.  Instabilities result from
 *  identifying new pairs or sequences of characters that are visually
 *  confusable, and thus must be mapped to the same skeleton character(s).
